revert(deps): Remove pytest-cov and jsonschema from pyproject.toml

This commit reverts the addition of `pytest-cov` and `jsonschema` to the `pyproject.toml` dependencies.

Reasoning:
- The environment does not have `pytest-cov` or `coverage.py` installed, preventing code coverage reporting.
- `jsonschema` was added as a dependency for schema validation, but since code coverage cannot be performed, and to maintain a clean state, it is also being removed from the dependencies for now.

Further action is required to install these packages in the environment to enable code coverage reporting and full schema validation.
