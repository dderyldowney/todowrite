title: Current ToDoWrite System State for Enhancement
description: >
  System currently has 29 nodes (25 planning + 4 commands) in production,
  validated JSON schema, complete CLI with 6 ToDoWrite commands, Makefile
  automation with 12 targets, and full validation toolchain. All nodes are
  functional but lack execution status tracking. Need to enhance without
  breaking existing functionality or requiring migration of current plans.
