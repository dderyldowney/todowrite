## Overview

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: CHANGELOG.md must be regenerated, formatted, and included in every git commit to maintain comprehensive version history for the AFS FastAPI agricultural robotics platform.

**Purpose**: Ensure complete change tracking essential for safety-critical agricultural systems where regulatory compliance, debugging, and safety audits require detailed version history.

## Automatic Generation Requirements

### Cross-Session Enforcement

**ALL sessions must ensure**:
1. **CHANGELOG.md regeneration** before every commit
2. **Proper formatting** according to Keep a Changelog standards
3. **Inclusion in commit** so CHANGELOG.md reflects all changes up to and including that commit
4. **Agricultural context** in all changelog entries for safety-critical changes

### Generation Protocol

**Before Every Commit**:
1. **Regenerate CHANGELOG.md** using git commit history
2. **Format according to standards** (Keep a Changelog format)
3. **Add to git staging** alongside other changes
4. **Commit with updated changelog** ensuring completeness

## CHANGELOG.md Format Standards

### Structure Template
```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to the AFS FastAPI Agricultural Robotics Platform will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### Entry Classification

**Change Types** (aligned with commit separation):
- **Added**: New features, capabilities, or infrastructure (`feat` commits)
- **Changed**: Modifications to existing functionality (`refactor`, `perf` commits)
- **Fixed**: Bug corrections and issue resolution (`fix` commits)
- **Security**: Security improvements and safety enhancements (`security` commits)
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates and improvements (`docs` commits)
- **Configuration**: Build, tooling, and configuration changes (`config` commits)

### Agricultural Context Requirements

**Safety-Critical Entries** must include:
- Agricultural equipment impact description
- Safety compliance considerations (ISO 18497, ISO 11783)
- Multi-tractor coordination implications
- Field operation reliability effects

## Implementation Commands

### Manual Generation Command
```bash
# Generate CHANGELOG.md from git history
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s (%an, %ad)" --date=short > temp_changelog.txt

# Process and format according to Keep a Changelog standards
# Include agricultural context for safety-critical changes
# Organize by version and change type
```

### Automated Integration
```bash
# Before every commit workflow:
1. Generate updated CHANGELOG.md
2. Format according to standards
3. Add to git staging: git add CHANGELOG.md
4. Commit with complete changelog: git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

## Cross-Session Persistence

### Configuration Integration

**CLAUDE.md Requirements**:
- CHANGELOG.md regeneration mandatory before commits
- Format-first application to changelog content
- Agricultural context requirements for safety entries
- Cross-session enforcement through embedded configuration

**Pre-Commit Hook Integration**:
- Validate CHANGELOG.md exists and is updated
- Ensure proper formatting according to Keep a Changelog standards
- Verify agricultural context in safety-critical entries
- Prevent commits without updated changelog

### Command Storage

**`.claude/commands/updatechangelog.md`**:
- Automated CHANGELOG.md generation command
