make tw-prove
```

### `make tw-hooks`

Installs git commit message hooks for Conventional Commits enforcement.

```bash
make tw-hooks
```

### `make tw-clean`

make tw-test
```

## Examples

### Complete Workflow Example

1. **Initialize the system:**
   ```bash
   make tw-deps
   make tw-init
   ```

2. **Create a planning hierarchy:**
   ```bash
   todowrite create Goal "Agricultural Automation" "Implement autonomous farming coordination"
   todowrite create Concept "Robot Fleet Management" "Coordinate multiple autonomous tractors" --parent GOAL-AGRICULTURAL-AUTOMATION
   ```

3. **Validate the planning structure:**
   ```bash
   todowrite todowrite validate-plan --strict
   todowrite todowrite trace-links
   ```

4. **Generate and execute verification commands:**
   ```bash
   todowrite todowrite generate-commands
   todowrite todowrite execute-commands --all
   ```

5. **Check system compliance:**
   ```bash
   todowrite todowrite check-soc
   make tw-check
   ```

### Error Handling

All commands provide clear error messages and exit codes:

- **Exit code 0**: Success
- **Exit code 1**: Validation errors or command failures

Example error output:
```
‚ùå Plan validation failed
ERROR: Invalid YAML in configs/plans/goals/GOAL-EXAMPLE.yaml: mapping values are not allowed here
  in "<unicode string>", line 3, column 8
```
