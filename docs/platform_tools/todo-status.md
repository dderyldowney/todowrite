# `todo-status` Command Documentation

## Purpose

The `todo-status` command provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the AFS FastAPI Dual TODO System. It displays the progress of both strategic objectives and the active development phase, offering a quick glance at the project's development momentum and immediate next steps.

## Usage

To view the current TODO system status, execute the `todo-status` command from your project's root directory:

```bash
./bin/todo-status
```

## Key Features

*   **Strategic Development Momentum**: Shows the total, completed, and pending strategic objectives, along with a progress bar and a list of next high-priority objectives.
*   **Current Phase Implementation**: Displays details of the active development phase, including its description, start time, strategic alignment, progress (total, completed, pending steps, and a progress bar), and a list of immediate next steps within the phase.
*   **Development System Overview**: Provides a summary of the total strategic objectives, active development phases, and current phase steps.
*   **Quick Command Reference**: Offers a convenient list of related commands for strategic management, phase management, and integrated management of the TODO system.

## Agricultural Context

In the context of the AFS FastAPI Agricultural Robotics Platform, `todo-status` is essential for:

*   **Project Visibility**: Providing clear visibility into the development roadmap and current progress for all stakeholders, including agricultural engineers, robotics engineers, and AI specialists.
*   **Prioritization**: Highlighting next high-priority strategic objectives and phase steps, ensuring that development efforts are focused on the most critical tasks for agricultural applications.
*   **Compliance Tracking**: Supporting the tracking of development activities, which can be linked to compliance requirements for agricultural standards like ISO 18497 and ISO 11783.
*   **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Facilitating effective coordination among multiple AI agents and human developers by offering a shared, up-to-date view of project tasks and progress.
