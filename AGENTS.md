## Instructions

## How to Use

**Universal Session Management Commands**: All AI agents have access to 7 session management commands (loadsession, savesession, runtests, whereweare, updatedocs, updatechangelog, updatewebdocs).

**Complete command specifications**: See [SESSION_SUMMARY.md - Universal Session Management Commands](SESSION_SUMMARY.md#universal-session-management-commands) for usage, functionality, and references.

**Critical commands**:
- Initialize sessions: `./bin/loadsession` (execute after starting new sessions)
- End sessions: `./bin/savesession` (capture state before ending)
- Strategic assessment: `./bin/whereweare` (display) or `./bin/whereweare --generate` (regenerate)

**Seven Mandatory Requirements** (see [SESSION_SUMMARY.md](SESSION_SUMMARY.md#mandatory-requirements-for-all-ai-agents) for complete details):
- Test-First Development, Structured Investigation Pattern, Standardized Test Reporting, CHANGELOG Loop Protection, Git Commit Separation, Cross-Agent Infrastructure Sharing, **Mandatory Pause Structure Enforcement**
- **ABSOLUTE Red-Green-Refactor (RGR) adherence**: See [RED_GREEN_REFACTOR_ABSOLUTE_ENFORCEMENT.md](RED_GREEN_REFACTOR_ABSOLUTE_ENFORCEMENT.md) for zero-exceptions policy. Green status must only be achieved through actual working implementation code; 'pass' is prohibited as a means to gain green status. No code is to be generated until a well-defined and detailed set of tests defining the expected behavior(s) have been generated and their logic verified.
- **MANDATORY Pause Structure Compliance**: See [PAUSE_STRUCTURE_SPECIFICATION.md](PAUSE_STRUCTURE_SPECIFICATION.md) for complete requirements. ALL AI agents MUST implement the "Recommended Pause Structure for Session Optimization" with zero exceptions. This includes task-level pauses (every 2-3 tasks), phase-level pauses (phase completion), and strategic milestone pauses (strategic goal completion). Session limits of 3 hours MUST be enforced with automatic pause triggers.

**Essential documentation**:
- Session architecture: `docs/EXECUTION_ORDER.md` (6-phase initialization, 28+ files)
- Testing guidance: `WORKFLOW.md`, `TDD_WORKFLOW.md`, `TDD_FRAMEWORK_MANDATORY.md`
- Synchronization specs: `SYNCHRONIZATION_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`, `STATE_OF_AFFAIRS.md`
- Platform standards: `CLAUDE.md` (professional tone and documentation requirements)
- Test validation: Ensure all 214 tests pass (see `WORKFLOW.md`)

## Configuration

- Python: `>=3.12,<3.13` (see `pyproject.toml`)
- **Quality gates**: Ruff, Black, MyPy, isort; zero warnings expected (195 tests maintained)
- **TDD enforcement hooks** (required):
  - `.claude/hooks/tdd_enforcement.py` - Validates Test-First Development compliance
  - `.claude/hooks/safety_validation.py` - Ensures agricultural safety standards compliance
- **Documentation style**: NumPy-style docstrings; dual audience (educational + professional)
- **Safety & standards**: See [SESSION_SUMMARY.md - Agricultural Robotics Context](SESSION_SUMMARY.md#agricultural-robotics-context) for ISO compliance requirements
- **Performance requirements**: Sub-millisecond coordination operations for embedded agricultural systems

### Environment Sanity (pyenv)

- Verify pyenv before development:
  - `pyenv --version` prints a version with no errors
  - `pyenv rehash` runs clean (no “shims isn’t writable”)
- If shims warning appears: `chmod u+rwx ~/.pyenv/shims && pyenv rehash`.
- Keep zsh init in `~/.zshrc`; ensure `~/.bash_profile` is bash-safe, for example:
  - `export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"`
  - `[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"`
  - `eval "$(pyenv init -)"`
  - Optionally: `eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"` if plugin installed
- See the Quick Verification Checklist in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full procedure.

## Dependencies

- Runtime: `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `starlette`, `pydantic`
- Dev/Test: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `httpx`, `mypy`, `ruff`, `black`, `isort`
- See `pyproject.toml` for pinned versions and scripts

## Examples

- **Mandatory TDD workflow** (enforced by pre-commit hooks):
  1) **RED**: Create/extend test in `tests/` that fails, including agricultural context
  2) Run `pytest` to confirm RED phase - test must fail initially
  3) **GREEN**: Implement minimal code in `afs_fastapi/` to satisfy test requirements
  4) Run `pytest` to confirm GREEN phase - test now passes
  5) **REFACTOR**: Enhance code quality while maintaining test coverage
  6) Ensure all quality gates pass: `ruff`, `black`, `mypy`, `isort` (zero warnings)
  7) Pre-commit hooks validate TDD compliance and agricultural safety standards
- **Git Commit Separation of Concerns** (enforced by pre-commit hooks):
  1) Each commit addresses exactly one concern: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `config`, `perf`, `security`
  2) Use conventional format: `type(scope): description` with agricultural context
  3) Examples: `feat(equipment): add tractor synchronization`, `fix(safety): resolve emergency stop timing`
  4) Pre-commit validation prevents commits addressing multiple concerns
  5) See `GIT_COMMIT_SEPARATION_MANDATORY.md` for complete guidelines
- **Session workflow**: `./bin/loadsession` → `./bin/whereweare` → review project state → develop → `./bin/savesession` (before ending)
- **Command details**: See [SESSION_SUMMARY.md - Universal Session Management Commands](SESSION_SUMMARY.md#universal-session-management-commands) for complete usage examples and functionality

## VS Code & CLI Workflows

- VS Code tasks (suggested):
  - Run API: command `python -m afs_fastapi` (uses env vars below)
  - Run tests: command `pytest -q`
  - Linters/formatters: `ruff check . && black --check . && mypy .`
- Environment variables for running the API:
  - `AFS_API_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`)
  - `AFS_API_PORT` (default `8000`)
  - `AFS_API_RELOAD` (`true/false`, default `false`)
  - `AFS_API_LOG_LEVEL` (`debug|info|warning|error`, default `info`)
- Handy CLI snippets:
  - Start API quickly: `AFS_API_RELOAD=1 python -m afs_fastapi`
  - Exercise OpenAPI docs: open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
  - Run focused tests: `pytest -q tests/services/test_*.py -k fleet`
  - Type-check changed files: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | rg ".py$" | xargs -r mypy`
  - Lint and format: `ruff check . && black . && isort .`
  - Pre-commit: `make precommit-install` then `make precommit-run`
  - Pytest config now in `pytest.ini` (kept minimal; mirrors previous pyproject settings)

## Recommended VS Code Settings (optional)

- Python interpreter: use `.venv` if present; otherwise configure 3.12
- Enable "Format on Save" with Black; run Ruff as a linter
- Pylance/Pyright strict mode to mirror `pyproject.toml`
- Set test discovery to `pytest` with `tests` as root

## Pre-commit Hooks (Required Enforcement)

- **Config**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (local hooks; no network dependency)
- **Enforced on every commit** (blocks non-compliant code):
  - **Code quality**: Ruff (lint), Black (format check), isort (imports), MyPy (types)
  - **TDD enforcement**: `.claude/hooks/tdd_enforcement.py` - Validates Test-First Development
  - **Safety validation**: `.claude/hooks/safety_validation.py` - Ensures agricultural safety compliance
  - **Commit separation**: `.claude/hooks/commit_separation_enforcement.py` - Enforces single concern per commit
- **Installation**: `make precommit-install` (installs pre-commit and registers hooks)
- **Manual execution**: `make precommit-run` (run all hooks without committing)
- **Status**: ACTIVE and ENFORCED - prevents non-compliant code and commits from entering codebase

## Coding Conventions (Agricultural Robotics Standards)

- **Naming**: Clear, conversational naming following PEP 8 with agricultural domain context
- **Type safety**: Precise type hints; maintain mypy strict mode compliance (zero warnings)
- **Function design**: Compact, purposeful functions avoiding over-engineering
- **Testing requirements**: Comprehensive tests with realistic agricultural scenarios and performance validation
- **Documentation standards**: Professional tone with concrete agricultural examples and educational context
- **Safety compliance**: All equipment and coordination code must include safety considerations (see [SESSION_SUMMARY.md - Agricultural Robotics Context](SESSION_SUMMARY.md#agricultural-robotics-context))
- **Performance constraints**: Code must meet embedded agricultural equipment limitations (<1ms coordination operations)

## Mandatory TDD and Explanation Workflow

All agents must adhere to a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow, specifically the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. This process is mandatory and serves as a foundational development practice.

1.  **Educate and Explain:** For every significant action, you must first educate on the **WHY** of your choices (the reasoning and strategic decisions) and then explain the **HOW** of your implementation (the technical details of the code generation).

2.  **Red Phase (Write a Failing Test):** Before writing any implementation code, you MUST first write a test. This test must initially fail (be 'Red'). The failure must be for a valid reason, such as an `AssertionError` because the expected output does not match the actual output of the unimplemented feature. Tests that fail simply because a module or function is not yet defined are insufficient. The test itself is a piece of living documentation and must be clear and purposeful.

3.  **Green Phase (Write Code to Pass the Test):** After creating a failing test, you will write the minimum amount of implementation code necessary to make the test pass (turn 'Green'). When presenting this code, you MUST explain **WHY** you chose that specific implementation and **HOW** it directly fulfills the requirements defined by the test.

4.  **Refactor Phase:** Once the test is passing, you may refactor the code for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability. You must explain the refactoring changes and the reasoning behind them.

All generated code, tests, and documentation must be of professional quality, well-commented, and serve as a clear record of the system's functionality. The tests themselves are considered living documentation.
