All features and scenarios are directly linked to implementation through mandatory unit tests.\n\n=== OVERVIEW ===\nThe ToDoWrite web frontend provides a dual-mode interface that serves both non-programmers and power users through the same underlying 12-layer hierarchical task management system.\n\n=== CORE USER JOURNEYS DOCUMENTED ===\n\n1. SIMPLE MODE FIRST-TIME USER JOURNEY (AC-92BA88357934)\n   • Target: Non-programmers, personal project managers\n   • Goal: Zero technical complexity, immediate productivity\n   • Key Features: Everyday language, guided workflows, visual progress\n   • Unit Tests Required: 7 comprehensive test scenarios\n\n2. TEMPLATE-BASED PROJECT CREATION (AC-663E378ACEE0)\n   • Target: Users wanting quick project starts\n   • Goal: Reduce planning overhead with proven structures\n   • Key Features: Template library, customization wizard, smart defaults\n   • Unit Tests Required: 5 test scenarios covering full template workflow\n\n3. VISUAL RELATIONSHIP BUILDING (AC-227495379E3A)\n   • Target: Users managing complex interdependencies\n   • Goal: Intuitive understanding of project relationships\n   • Key Features: Drag-and-drop linking, dependency visualization, conflict detection\n   • Unit Tests Required: 6 test scenarios for relationship management\n\n4. ADVANCED MODE POWER USER JOURNEY (AC-7BB10CDC9D87)\n   • Target: Technical users, project managers, developers\n   • Goal: Full access to 12-layer ToDoWrite system\n   • Key Features: Complete technical interface, bulk operations, command execution\n   • Unit Tests Required: 7 test scenarios covering advanced functionality\n\n5. SEARCH AND DISCOVERY SYSTEM (AC-859BE71A8ED0)\n   • Target: Users with large project portfolios\n   • Goal: Quick information retrieval across all projects\n   • Key Features: Natural language search, advanced filtering, saved queries\n   • Unit Tests Required: 6 test scenarios for search functionality\n\n6. IMPORT/EXPORT AND DATA PORTABILITY (AC-C7C14FAD4758)\n   • Target: Users needing data control and migration\n   • Goal: Complete data ownership and portability\n   • Key Features: Multiple format support, conflict resolution, cloud sync\n   • Unit Tests Required: 6 test scenarios for data operations\n\n7. REAL-TIME COLLABORATION AND TEAM WORKFLOWS (AC-7D44921553C3)\n   • Target: Teams working on shared projects\n   • Goal: Synchronized team coordination and communication\n   • Key Features: Live updates, assignment management, permission control\n   • Unit Tests Required: 6 test scenarios for collaboration features\n\n=== MANDATORY TESTING REQUIREMENTS ===\nTOTAL UNIT TESTS REQUIRED: 43 comprehensive test scenarios\nEach feature includes detailed unit test specifications that:\n• Follow strict TDD methodology (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)\n• Use real implementations only (NO MOCKING ALLOWED)\n• Include type hints and annotations (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n• Provide triple-verification coverage (unit, integration, manual)\n• Drive actual implementation code development\n\n=== IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH ===\n1. Each scenario becomes a failing test first (RED PHASE)\n2. Minimal implementation to make tests pass (GREEN PHASE)\n3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage (REFACTOR PHASE)\n4. Triple-verification ensures quality and functionality\n\n=== NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS ===\n• TDD MANDATORY for all code development\n• NO MOCKING - Real implementations only\n• TYPE HINTS AND ANNOTATIONS required everywhere\n• TRIPLE-VERIFICATION for all components\n• Living documentation drives implementation\n• Features and Scenarios are binding requirements\n\n=== USER SUCCESS METRICS ===\n• First-time users complete projects within 10 minutes\n• Template users achieve 80% faster project setup\n• Relationship management reduces planning errors by 90%\n• Advanced users access 100% of ToDoWrite functionality\n• Search reduces information finding time by 75%\n• Data portability ensures zero vendor lock-in\n• Team collaboration improves project delivery by 60%\n\nThis living documentation will be continuously updated as user feedback is gathered and the system evolves. All features and scenarios are directly linked to specific unit tests that ensure implementation quality and correctness.\")",
