# Restore Enforcement After /clear

This command restores full ToDoWrite enforcement systems after a `/clear` command has reset the session context.

## What Happens When You Run This

The command will:
1. Run session initialization to reactivate session markers and agent registry
2. Activate permanent code quality enforcement systems
3. Initialize project-specific episodic memory database connection
4. Verify all quality gates and compliance systems are active

## You'll See

- 🔒 Permanent enforcement activation message
- ✅ All quality gates marked as ENFORCED
- 🧠 Episodic memory ready confirmation
- 📋 Compliance system status

## When to Use

Run this if you notice after `/clear`:
- Missing enforcement messages
- No quality gate activations
- Episodic memory not responding
- Missing system status messages

The restoration ensures all ToDoWrite compliance systems are properly reactivated with the correct project-specific database paths.
