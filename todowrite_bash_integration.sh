# ToDoWrite Bash Integration
# ================================
#
# This file contains the shell integration logic for ToDoWrite's database architecture.
#
# To enable ToDoWrite's automatic database detection and loading:
#
# 1. Add this line to your ~/.bashrc:
#    source /path/to/todowrite/todowrite_bash_integration.sh
#
# 2. Or copy the contents below into your ~/.bashrc directly
#
# 3. Reload your shell with: source ~/.bashrc
#
# Architecture Overview:
# ===================
#
# Database Naming Convention:
# - Development: ~/dbs/{project}_{project}_development.db (collaborative planning)
# - Production:  ~/dbs/{project}_{project}_production.db  (end user deployments)
# - Testing:     $PROJECT_ROOT/tmp/todowrite_todowrite_testing.db (tests only)
#
# Directory Structure:
# - $PROJECT_ROOT: Monorepo root (contains lib_package, cli_package, web_package)
# - $PACKAGE_ROOT: Individual package directories
#
# Priority System:
# 1. Testing database (EXPLICIT USE ONLY by tests)
# 2. Development database (auto-loaded for collaborative work)
# 3. Production database (auto-loaded in production areas only)
