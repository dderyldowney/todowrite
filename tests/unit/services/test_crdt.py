"""Unit tests for CRDT implementations.

This module follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology to build
Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for the AFS FastAPI platform.

Agricultural Context:
CRDTs are essential for multi-tractor coordination in environments with
intermittent network connectivity, which is common in rural agricultural
settings. They allow tractors to independently update their local state
(e.g., which field sections have been harvested) and merge those states later
without conflicts, ensuring eventual consistency across the entire fleet.

This test suite begins with a G-Set (Grow-only Set), the simplest CRDT,
which will serve as the foundation for more complex agricultural data types.

        delivery. The receiving system must handle these duplicates gracefully.
