   ```bash
   # For PostgreSQL (production)
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost/afs_fastapi"
   alembic upgrade head

   # For local development (default)
   # Database automatically created on first use
   ```
7. **Verify installation with test suite**: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`

12. Import afs_fastapi into your project: `import afs_fastapi`

### Development and Testing

- **TDD workflow**: See [TDD_WORKFLOW.md](TDD_WORKFLOW.md) for Test-First development guide
- **Testing reference**: See [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) for complete testing architecture documentation
- **TodoWrite system**: Now a standalone package. See [todowrite/README.md](todowrite/README.md) for comprehensive user guide.
- **Task management**: See [todowrite/ToDoWrite.md](todowrite/ToDoWrite.md) for complete specification and integration requirements.
- **Quality standards**: Zero linting warnings maintained (run `ruff check .` to verify)

Note on extras: The project uses `fastapi[all]` and `starlette[full]` in development to enable optional features commonly exercised in tests and local runs (e.g., test client utilities, templating, multipart/form-data handling, and uvicorn's standard extras). This keeps "pip install -r requirements.txt" sufficient for running tests and docs locally.

### Development Workflow

AFS FastAPI uses **Test-First Development (TDD)** for ALL code development. Follow these guidelines:

**1. Test-First Development (MANDATORY)**:
- Follow **Red-Green-Refactor** methodology outlined in [TDD_WORKFLOW.md](TDD_WORKFLOW.md)
- Write failing tests first, then implement minimal code to pass
- Refactor for quality while maintaining test coverage
- Agricultural context required in all test scenarios

**2. General Development**:
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for Quick Verification Checklist
- Run full test suite: `python -m pytest tests/` (expect 846 tests passing)
- Verify TodoWrite system: `./bin/todo-status`
- Maintain zero linting warnings: `ruff check .`
- Follow git commit separation: `type(scope): description`
- Database migrations: Use `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"` for schema changes

**Key Documentation**:
- **WORKFLOW.md**: Authoritative testing reference and architecture guide
- **TDD_WORKFLOW.md**: Complete Test-First development methodology
- **ToDoWrite-HOWTO.md**: Comprehensive TodoWrite user guide (600+ lines)
- **ToDoWrite.md**: Complete specification and integration requirements
- **TDD_FRAMEWORK_MANDATORY.md**: Mandatory TDD policy with enforcement details
- **GIT_COMMIT_SEPARATION_MANDATORY.md**: Separation of concerns policy
- **SESSION_SUMMARY.md**: Project evolution and strategic direction

**Quality Standards**:
- **Test coverage**: All new components require comprehensive tests written FIRST
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond operations for real-time agricultural coordination
- **Documentation**: Dual-purpose code serving both functional and educational objectives
- **Agricultural context**: ISO compliance and safety-critical system considerations

## Security Notes

This project enables automated checks (Dependabot + pip-audit) for dependency vulnerabilities. Two current advisories are known and monitored:

- **Starlette 0.41.3: GHSA-2c2j-9gv5-cj73 (CVE-2025-54121)** - **UNRESOLVED**
  - Summary: Large multipart form uploads may block the event loop while rolling files to disk.
  - Current version: **0.41.3** (vulnerable)
  - Fixed in: Starlette >= 0.47.2
  - Project impact: This API does not use multipart uploads; risk is low in our deployment.
  - Status: Awaiting compatible FastAPI release that supports Starlette >= 0.47.2.

- **h11 0.14.0: GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj (CVE-2025-43859)** - **UNRESOLVED**
  - Summary: Lenient chunked-encoding parsing could enable request smuggling in specific proxy scenarios.
  - Current version: **0.14.0** (vulnerable)
  - Fixed in: h11 >= 0.16.0
  - Project impact: h11 is used via httpx/httpcore for HTTP client operations. Server stack uses Uvicorn/Starlette. Risk is low in typical deployments with proper reverse proxy configuration.
  - Status: Upgrade blocked by httpcore compatibility. Requires httpcore >= 1.0.9 which conflicts with current httpx pinning.

**Recent Security Improvements (January 2025)**:
- ✅ **requests**: Upgraded to 2.32.5 (latest) - includes URI parsing security improvements
- ✅ **urllib3**: Upgraded to 2.5.0 (latest) - fixes redirect vulnerability (security patch)
- ✅ **setuptools**: Upgraded to 80.9.0 (latest) - stability and security updates

**Mitigations in place**:
- No multipart form endpoints are exposed in the API.
- HTTP client usage is limited to development/testing scenarios.
- CI automatically flags vulnerabilities and proposes coordinated updates.
- Reverse proxy configurations should include proper request validation.
