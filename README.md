### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dderyldowney/afs_fastapi.git`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd afs_fastapi`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. **Verify installation with test suite**: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
   - **Expected result**: 802 tests passing in ~3 seconds
   - Includes distributed systems, TDD implementation, and agricultural robotics validation
7. Install build tools: `pip install build`
8. Build the project: `python -m build`
9. Install the generated wheel file: `pip install dist/afs_fastapi-0.1.3-py3-none-any.whl`
10. Import afs_fastapi into your project: `import afs_fastapi`

### Development and Testing

- **TDD workflow**: See [TDD_WORKFLOW.md](TDD_WORKFLOW.md) for Test-First development guide
- **Testing reference**: See [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) for complete testing architecture documentation
- **Quality standards**: Zero linting warnings maintained (run `ruff check .` to verify)

Note on extras: The project uses `fastapi[all]` and `starlette[full]` in development to enable optional features commonly exercised in tests and local runs (e.g., test client utilities, templating, multipart/form-data handling, and uvicorn's standard extras). This keeps "pip install -r requirements.txt" sufficient for running tests and docs locally.

### Development Workflow

AFS FastAPI uses **Test-First Development (TDD)** for ALL code development. Follow these guidelines:

**1. Test-First Development (MANDATORY)**:
- Follow **Red-Green-Refactor** methodology outlined in [TDD_WORKFLOW.md](TDD_WORKFLOW.md)
- Write failing tests first, then implement minimal code to pass
- Refactor for quality while maintaining test coverage
- Agricultural context required in all test scenarios

**2. General Development**:
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for Quick Verification Checklist
- Run full test suite: `python -m pytest tests/` (expect 802 tests passing)
- Maintain zero linting warnings: `ruff check .`
- Follow git commit separation: `type(scope): description`

**Key Documentation**:
- **WORKFLOW.md**: Authoritative testing reference and architecture guide
- **TDD_WORKFLOW.md**: Complete Test-First development methodology
- **TDD_FRAMEWORK_MANDATORY.md**: Mandatory TDD policy with enforcement details
- **GIT_COMMIT_SEPARATION_MANDATORY.md**: Separation of concerns policy
- **SESSION_SUMMARY.md**: Project evolution and strategic direction

**Quality Standards**:
- **Test coverage**: All new components require comprehensive tests written FIRST
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond operations for real-time agricultural coordination
- **Documentation**: Dual-purpose code serving both functional and educational objectives
- **Agricultural context**: ISO compliance and safety-critical system considerations

## Security Notes

This project enables automated checks (Dependabot + pip-audit) for dependency vulnerabilities. Two current advisories are known and monitored:

- **Starlette 0.41.3: GHSA-2c2j-9gv5-cj73 (CVE-2025-54121)** - **UNRESOLVED**
  - Summary: Large multipart form uploads may block the event loop while rolling files to disk.
  - Current version: **0.41.3** (vulnerable)
  - Fixed in: Starlette >= 0.47.2
  - Project impact: This API does not use multipart uploads; risk is low in our deployment.
  - Status: Awaiting compatible FastAPI release that supports Starlette >= 0.47.2.

- **h11 0.14.0: GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj (CVE-2025-43859)** - **UNRESOLVED**
  - Summary: Lenient chunked-encoding parsing could enable request smuggling in specific proxy scenarios.
  - Current version: **0.14.0** (vulnerable)
  - Fixed in: h11 >= 0.16.0
  - Project impact: h11 is used via httpx/httpcore for HTTP client operations. Server stack uses Uvicorn/Starlette. Risk is low in typical deployments with proper reverse proxy configuration.
  - Status: Upgrade blocked by httpcore compatibility. Requires httpcore >= 1.0.9 which conflicts with current httpx pinning.

**Recent Security Improvements (January 2025)**:
- ✅ **requests**: Upgraded to 2.32.5 (latest) - includes URI parsing security improvements
- ✅ **urllib3**: Upgraded to 2.5.0 (latest) - fixes redirect vulnerability (security patch)
- ✅ **setuptools**: Upgraded to 80.9.0 (latest) - stability and security updates

**Mitigations in place**:
- No multipart form endpoints are exposed in the API.
- HTTP client usage is limited to development/testing scenarios.
- CI automatically flags vulnerabilities and proposes coordinated updates.
- Reverse proxy configurations should include proper request validation.
