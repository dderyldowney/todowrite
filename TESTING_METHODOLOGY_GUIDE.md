## 🔄 Generation Process

### Command Sequence

**1. Execute Core Test Suite**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
# Expected: 129/129 tests passing in ~1.08s
```

**2. Validate Code Quality** (Execute in parallel):
```bash
ruff check .                    # Linting validation
mypy afs_fastapi/              # Type checking
black --check .                # Code formatting
isort --check-only .           # Import organization
# Expected: Zero warnings across all tools
```

**3. Test Command Infrastructure**:
```bash
./test_loadsession.sh
# Expected: 14/15 tests passing (93% success rate)
```

**4. Generate Comprehensive Report**:
- Analyze all test results and quality metrics
- Create professional FULL_TEST_SUITE_REPORT.md documentation
- Include professional formatting and strategic analysis

### Automated Command Integration

**Future Implementation**: Create `fulltest` executable script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Execute complete test suite and generate report
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short > test_results.log
ruff check . > quality_results.log
# ... process results and generate FULL_TEST_SUITE_REPORT.md
```
