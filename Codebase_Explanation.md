# ToDoWrite Codebase Explanation

## Overview
**ToDoWrite** is a sophisticated **hierarchical task management system** designed for managing complex software projects. It's built as a Python monorepo with a clean separation between core business logic and user interfaces.

## Architecture

### 1. **Monorepo Structure**
```
todowrite/
├── lib_package/          # Core library (business logic)
├── cli_package/          # Command-line interface
├── web_package/          # Web interface (Docker-based)
├── tests/               # Comprehensive test suite
├── scripts/             # Build/deployment automation
├── docs/                # Documentation
└── dev_tools/           # Development utilities
```

### 2. **Core Library (lib_package)**
The heart of the system with these key components:

#### **Hierarchical Data Model**
- **12 Layer Types**: Goal, Concept, Context, Constraints, Requirements, AcceptanceCriteria, InterfaceContract, Phase, Step, Task, SubTask, Command
- **6 Status Types**: planned, in_progress, completed, blocked, cancelled, rejected
- **10 Work Types**: architecture, spec, interface, validation, implementation, docs, ops, refactor, chore, test
- **Rich Metadata**: owner, labels, severity, work_type, assignee

#### **Multi-Backend Storage**
1. **PostgreSQL** (primary)
2. **SQLite** (fallback)
3. **YAML files** (last resort)
4. **Automatic fallback** with smart detection

#### **Core Library Classes**
The core library is organized into several key modules:

**Core Classes (`lib_package/src/todowrite/core/`)**
- `Node` (`types.py:72`): Main entity representing hierarchical tasks with metadata
- `ToDoWrite` (`app.py:76`): Primary orchestration class managing all operations
- `NodeUpdater` (`app_node_updater.py`): Handles node updates and validation
- `Metadata` (`types.py:36`): Container for node metadata (owner, labels, severity, work_type, assignee)
- `Link` (`types.py:47`): Represents parent-child relationships between nodes
- `Command` (`types.py:55`): Defines executable commands with artifacts
- `Label` (`types.py:64`): Tagging and categorization system

**Database Models (`lib_package/src/todowrite/database/models.py`)**
- `Node`: Main database entity with all node fields and relationships
- `Link`: Parent-child relationship table (many-to-many)
- `Label`: Tag system with many-to-many node relationship
- `Command`: Executable commands linked to nodes
- `Artifact`: Output artifacts generated by commands

**Storage Layer (`lib_package/src/todowrite/storage/`)**
- `YAMLStorage`: YAML file-based storage backend
- `SchemaValidator`: Cross-backend schema validation
- `YAMLManager`: Database-YAML synchronization

**Tools (`lib_package/src/todowrite/tools/`)**
- `tw_validate.py`: Node validation utilities
- `tw_trace.py`: Relationship tracing and analysis
- `tw_lint_soc.py`: Social coding linting
- `extract_schema.py`: Schema extraction utilities

### 3. **CLI Interface (cli_package)**
Rich terminal interface built with Click and Rich:
- **CRUD Operations**: create, get, list, update, delete
- **Status Management**: progress tracking, status updates
- **Import/Export**: YAML synchronization, bulk operations
- **Search**: Text-based search across all nodes

### 4. **Database Model Structure**
The database schema is designed around a hierarchical node system:

**Node Table (`nodes`)**
- `id` (String, Primary Key): Unique identifier
- `layer` (String): One of 12 layer types
- `title` (String): Node title
- `description` (Text): Optional description
- `status` (String): One of 6 status types (default: "planned")
- `progress` (Integer): Progress percentage (optional)
- `started_date` (String): Start date (optional)
- `completion_date` (String): Completion date (optional)
- `owner` (String): Node owner (optional)
- `severity` (String): Severity level (optional)
- `work_type` (String): Work type (optional)
- `assignee` (String): Assigned person (optional)

**Relationship Tables**
- `links`: Many-to-many parent-child relationships between nodes
- `node_labels`: Many-to-many relationship between nodes and labels
- `commands`: One-to-one relationship with nodes for executable commands
- `artifacts`: One-to-many relationship with commands for output artifacts

**Key Relationships**
- Nodes have self-referential many-to-many parent/child relationships
- Nodes can have multiple labels (tags)
- Nodes can have one command with multiple artifacts

### 5. **Key Features**

#### **Schema Validation**
- JSONSchema validation across all storage backends
- Cross-platform data integrity guarantees
- Automatic migration and synchronization

#### **Command System**
- Executable commands with artifacts
- Output capture and storage
- Integration with development workflows

#### **Development Tools**
- `tw_validate`: Node validation
- `tw_trace`: Relationship tracing
- `tw_lint_soc`: Social coding linting
- `extract_schema`: Schema extraction

### 6. **Build System & Development**

#### **Modern Python Tooling**
- **uv**: Modern package management (recently integrated)
- **Hatchling**: Build backend with shared version management
- **Ruff**: All-in-one linting and formatting
- **Pytest**: Testing with coverage requirements

#### **Quality Assurance**
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Comprehensive type annotations (Python 3.12+)
- Security auditing with Bandit
- 46+ test files covering all components

### 7. **Data Flow**

```
User Input → CLI → Core Library → Storage Backend
                ↓
          Schema Validation
                ↓
          Database/YAML Storage
```

## Key Strengths

1. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type annotations
3. **Multi-Backend Support**: Flexible storage with fallbacks
4. **Rich CLI**: Modern terminal interface
5. **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for new features
6. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing and error handling

## Current State
- **Active Development**: Recent commits show uv integration and cleanup
- **Mature Architecture**: Well-established patterns and comprehensive feature set
- **Build Issue**: There's a known issue with the hatchling build process mentioned in recent conversations

The codebase represents a well-engineered approach to hierarchical task management, balancing flexibility, reliability, and developer experience.
